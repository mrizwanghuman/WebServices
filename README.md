I was trying to get trial membership of fileanywhere https://www.filesanywhere.com/personal/online-file-storage-pricing.aspx) but I guess they do not offer any more trial membership. So just to present my web service knowledge I created basic Webservice and consumed it. This is just basic calculation method using Simple Object Access Protocol. When you start debugging this project you will see an aspx.The page will have two input and button to perform addition. As you click the button it will add and show the total and list of previous additions.
